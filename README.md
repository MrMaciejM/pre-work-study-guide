# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The prework study guide was created to take notes of the things I have learned so far in HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript before the boot camp commences. It was also created to keep a few notes handy in case I need to refer to them during the boot camp.

It has helped me learn the usage of Git, pulling and pushing code via Git, as well as creating issues and branches to solve them.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Prework Study Guide can be used by opening it in VS Code and adding notes to the HTML file, which can be then displayed on a browser, and using Git it can be uploaded to GitHub to be shared with the class - anyone can download a copy of these notes on their local PC/laptop.
